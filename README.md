# Project Description: Implementing Sort, Filter, and Pagination in Java Spring without JPA - QFPS

## Introduction:
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of sorting, filtering, and pagination functionalities in a Java Spring application without utilizing Java Persistence API (JPA). By leveraging Spring's powerful features and standard Java libraries, this project provides a robust solution for managing large datasets efficiently, regardless of the data source, and allowing querying for various parameters.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a RESTful API that allows clients to:
1. Sort data based on specified criteria.
2. Filter data based on given parameters dynamically.
3. Paginate through large datasets to improve performance and user experience.

## Technologies Used:
- Java Spring Framework: For building the backend RESTful API.
- Spring Boot: For rapid application development and easy configuration.
- Spring MVC: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Java Collections Framework: For in-memory data storage and manipulation.
- Maven: For project management and dependency resolution.
- Swagger UI: For API documentation and testing.

## Key Features:
1. **Sorting:** Users can sort data based on one or multiple fields in ascending or descending order. This feature ensures flexibility in arranging the data according to user preferences.
2. **Filtering:** Users can apply filters dynamically to narrow down the dataset based on specific criteria. Filtering enhances data relevancy and usability by allowing users to focus on relevant information. The filtering mechanism supports querying for different parameters.
3. **Pagination:** Large datasets are paginated to improve performance and optimize resource utilization. Pagination divides the dataset into manageable chunks, reducing the load on the server and improving response times.
4. **Generic Implementation:** The solution is designed to be generic, allowing integration with different data sources. Whether the data comes from a database, an external API, or any other source, the implementation remains adaptable and scalable.
5. **Custom Business Logic:** Implement custom business logic if needed, such as complex filtering conditions or customized sorting algorithms.

## Implementation Approach:
1. **Controller Layer:** Define RESTful endpoints to handle sorting, filtering, and pagination requests.
2. **Service Layer:** Implement business logic to process sorting, filtering, and pagination operations. This layer orchestrates the data retrieval, manipulation, and formatting.
3. **Data Access Layer:** Utilize in-memory data structures (e.g., lists, maps) to store and manage the dataset. Implement methods for fetching, filtering, and sorting data efficiently. This layer should support dynamic querying for various parameters.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptional cases gracefully.
5. **Documentation:** Generate API documentation using Swagger UI to facilitate API exploration and testing.

## Benefits:
- Lightweight and efficient solution without the overhead of JPA.
- Improved performance and scalability, especially for small to medium-sized datasets.
- Greater control over data manipulation and business logic.
- Simplified deployment and maintenance.

## Conclusion:
This project showcases the implementation of sorting, filtering, and pagination functionalities in a Java Spring application without relying on JPA. By leveraging Spring's features and standard Java libraries, the project offers a versatile and efficient solution for managing and presenting data in RESTful APIs, adaptable to various data sources, and supporting dynamic querying for different parameters.
